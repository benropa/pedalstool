# Tech Blog

## Description

This project is to demonstrate our abilities in full stack development along with utilizing a database to hold data. With this we used tools like Sequelize, Handlebars, MySQL/jawsDB, Node.js, express.js, bootstrap, and additional styling through Pure. This project gave us the opportunity to practice not only our skills with recursion but also allowed us to get an oppotunity to create Routes through the Controller for the MVC model. The recursion that occurred during the project will be noticeable in the handlebars files for the blogs posts and the comments for the blog posts.

## Set Up

1. Install docker
2. Run ```npm run db:up```
3. Run ```npm run mysql```
4. Create database using schema.sql file
5. Run ```npm run seed```
